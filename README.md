# These are my submissions to Angela Yu's Full Stack Dev Udemy Course
*I skipped over the HTML and CSS modules and the repo contains code starting from the JS module.
I have used some advanced JS codes/concepts that have not been taught yet in each exercise since I knew some JS already, so proceed with caution.*

That's all for now.
