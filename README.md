# These are my submissions to [Angela Yu's Full Stack Dev Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp)
*I skipped over the HTML and CSS modules and the repo contains code starting from the JS module.
I have used some advanced JS codes/concepts that have not been taught yet in each exercise since I knew some JS already, so proceed with caution.*

To see demos of these projects, head over to my [projects website](https://malindus-projects.web.app/).

That's all for now.
